# insta_search

As an instagram user I find most product I want to buy on Instagram 
Most business owners in Nigeria are very small scale and cannot afford the whole process of managing and creating a website. Thereby most of them setup and instagram account.

How do I find products
For me personally I try to search for products using hashtags and hope instagram brings more similar pages to me . The draw back sometimes is finding a product that is close to me . That is because the business owner might not tag appropriately or something.
Even beyond that, its a bit difficult to search for service providers like makeup artists tailors etc on instagram  My ideal solution would be 
An instagram vendor has an instagram business page 
The vendor tags the category they belong to  The instagram vendor’s location is with in th business profile or can be easily accessed
insta search app will allow you select the product category I want
Or I can just search what I am looking for and the app uses ai to search for the most appropriate thing and then displays it to me
